# Image Gallery

A simple image gallery that lets users scroll horizontally through images using buttons or the mouse wheel. Each image is displayed in grayscale by default and transforms when hovered over.

## Features

- **Horizontal Scroll**: Scroll through the gallery using the mouse wheel or arrow buttons.
- **Image Hover Effect**: Images turn from grayscale to color and scale up when hovered.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts based on screen size for a smooth user experience.

## File Structure

```bash
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML structure of the image gallery
├── style.css          # Styles for the layout and hover effects
